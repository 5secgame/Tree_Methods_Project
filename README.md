This R script demonstrates the use of Decision Trees and Random Forests to classify colleges as either *Private* or *Public* based on their features in the *College* dataset from the `ISLR` package. The dataset is explored using visualizations from `ggplot2`, showing relationships between features such as *Room and Board*, *Graduation Rate*, and *Number of Full-Time Undergraduates*, while distinguishing between private and public institutions. Data preprocessing ensures no anomalies, such as a graduation rate exceeding 100%. The data is split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets using the `caTools` package. A decision tree model is trained using the `rpart` package, and its predictions are converted into categorical labels. The tree structure is visualized with `rpart.plot`. To enhance classification accuracy, a Random Forest model is trained using the `randomForest` package, providing insights into feature importance and generating a confusion matrix to evaluate performance. This project showcases the application of ensemble learning and interpretable models for binary classification tasks in education datasets.
